            <h1>Journey</h1>
            <p>As a software student, I have experience on using <br>
                python, html, css, figma. I have created a website <br>
                landing pafe with html and css. I have also created <br>
                Dzongkha spelling checker. I have done many <br>
                software projects and it has shaped me into a more <br>
                confident and capable developer with the help of <br>
                rigorous academic learning, practical application, and <br>
                personal growthThe adrenaline rush of brainstorming <br>
                with teammates, coding for hours, and presenting our <br>
                project to judges fostered a sense of camaraderie and <br>
                creativity.I learned how to write clean code,<br>
                participate in agile sprints, and engage in code <br>
                reviews, all while balancing multiple tasks. <br>
